## 🔍 Key Findings

### Identified Clusters:

| **Cluster** | **Description** |
|:------------|:----------------|
| **Cluster 1** | Lower average energy usage, sharp morning consumption spikes on weekdays, stable evening usage, more weekend activity |
| **Cluster 0** | Higher and more stable energy usage across the day, especially during peak hours (16:00–21:00), less weekend activity |

---

### 📌 Cluster 1 (Residential/Variable Entities)
- Likely represents **residential areas** or businesses with strong weekday/weekend behavioral differences.
- Features:
  - Lower total energy use
  - Morning peaks due to home routines (e.g., cooking, heating)
  - High variability on weekends (social activities, irregular behavior)

---

### 📌 Cluster 0 (Commercial/Industrial Entities)
- Likely represents **commercial buildings, factories, or institutions** operating consistently across weekdays.
- Features:
  - Higher total energy use
  - Steady daily consumption patterns
  - Large fluctuations during peak business hours

---

## 📈 General Insights

- **Behavioral segmentation** reveals actionable differences in how energy is consumed across customer types and time periods.
- **Weekend patterns** are a key differentiator between residential and commercial/institutional energy usage.
